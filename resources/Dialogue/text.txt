# 100 Five years ago, the world was at peace, animals of all races helped each other as civilizations grew. Until one day, shadow-like creatures attacked. They were called “Nightmares”, simply because that was the most fitting name for them. At first, the animals worked together to fight back against the Nightmares, but an endless stream of them overwhelmed the forces and many lives were lost. Little was known about the Nightmares. However, a scientist found out that an extremely rare type of stone in the shape of an orb, that he called the “Dream orb”, had the capability to stop the monsters from entering a radius of a league from the orb, about the size of a small city. The problem was that at the time, there had only been 9 orbs discovered, and the entirety of the animal population was nowhere near small enough to shelter in the 9 orbs. So the war against the Nightmares had turned into a war against ourselves. Cities like the Panda city are one of the few civilizations that stood throughout the conflict, having an orb heavily protected at its heart, but there are those who wish to steal their orb, driven by the sheer fear of the Nightmares.
